# Face-Monitoring-System-for-Safety-Measures

## Introduction

Safety and security are quite essential while travelling. This does not limit to vehicle robustness and its security features but also includes road accidents and other driving skills. Increasing number of deaths due to road accidents is one of the major issues all over the world. According to a recent survey conducted by the World Health Organisation, approximately 3700 people globally lose their lives daily in road accidents. Out of these, approximately, 20% death reasons are driver’s less consciousness on the road like distraction, drowsiness, fatigueness etc. 

Drowsiness is the state of “need for sleep” and fatigueness is defined as the “tiredness due to excessive workload”. In both the scenarios, the person is quite unaware of the events occurring in his surroundings similar to the drunk state. Drowsiness of the driver can lead to threat of many lives on the road. This short sleep may result in vehicle imbalancing, unnecessary road cuts and collisions. To eliminate this issue and provide security to drivers, our project detects the driver’s drowsiness using image processing and ML. The aim of our project is to detect driver’s drowsy state as soon as possible and blow a buzzer which alerts the driver. 

This project mainly detects drowsiness of a person by continuously scanning the eyes and face and recording the blinks of the eye. An alarm will be raised if the person’s eyes shut for a long period of time. Similarly, a trigger also raises the alarm if a person's eye is found to be distracted by some object, away from the road. This rising of alarm will alert the driver and thus necessary steps could be taken to avoid mishaps. Several other methods can also be implemented to check driver’s drowsiness and distraction as shown in figure.

## How to run the program

> **Software Requirements**
     
 1.  PYTHON >= 3.1 & <=3.6
 2. C & C++ compilers
 3. VISUAL STUDIO 2017
 
 **Note - Add all all the dependencies to the environment variable.**
 
 > **Setting up Virtual Environment**
 
 1. Open terminal (cmd/ bash).
 2. In the main project directory, use
          ```python -m pip install virtualenv```
 3. To activate virtual environment, use the following commands.
     ```
     python -m virtualenv venv
	cd venv/Scripts
     activate.bat
     ```
 
 > **Running up the program**
 
 1. Navigate to the [docs](https://github.com/TushitAgarwal/Face-Monitoring-System-for-Safety-Measures/tree/master/docs) folder in the terminal.
 2. Install all the python modules, using the command
     ```python -m pip install -r requirements.txt```
 3. Navigate to the [src](https://github.com/TushitAgarwal/Face-Monitoring-System-for-Safety-Measures/tree/master/src) folder in the terminal.
 4. Run the file using the command,
     ```python yawning_blink.py```
 
 **Note - Turn off the webcam before running the program.**
 
 ***That's all! The project is running.***
